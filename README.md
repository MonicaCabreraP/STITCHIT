## Building the tool
To build the tool *cmake*, a C++11 compiler and the boost library must be available.

Generate a build folder by typing:
`mkdir build`

Change into that folder:
`cd build`

To run *cmake* type:
`cmake ..`

To finally build the project type:
`make`

To execute all tests type:
`make test`

The tests can also be run individually, they are located in the folder
`build/test`
